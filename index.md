---

This is the website for the Workshop on Data Systems for
Interactive Analysis (DSIA). The [first edition of DSIA](/year/2015/) was held at
[IEEE VIS 2015](http://ieeevis.org/year/2015/info/vis-welcome/welcome), the [second edition of DSIA](/year/2017/) was held at
[IEEE VIS 2017](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/welcome), and the [third edition of DSIA](/year/2018/) was held at
[IEEE VIS 2018](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome).
We are thrilled to announce the fourth edition of the workshop, to be
held at [IEEE VIS 2019](http://ieeevis.org) in Vancouver.

We are very excited to announce that Magdalena Balazinska from the University of Washington will be the keynote speaker for the workshop.

**Title** The LightDB Video Database Management System

**Abstract** Video data management has recently re-emerged as an
active research area due to advances in machine learning
and graphics hardware, as well as the emergence of
applications such as adaptive streaming, object
detection, and virtual reality.
In this talk, we start with a review of the key requirements
of modern video data management and analytics applications.
We then present Visual Road, a new benchmark that we developed to
assess video database systems on the needs of those modern applications.
Finally, we dive into the details of LightDB, a new system that
we are building at the University of Washington for the storage,
retrieval, and analysis of video databases, including overlapping
videos and 360-degree videos.

**Bio** [Magdalena Balazinska](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/magda) is a Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington and the Director of the University of Washington data science institute called eScience. She is also the Associate Vice Provost for Data Science and the director of the Advanced Data Science PhD Option. Magdalena's research interests are in the field of database management systems. Her current research focuses on data management for data science, big data systems, cloud computing, and image and video analytics (including data management for VR/AR). Magdalena holds a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2006). She is a Microsoft Research New Faculty Fellow (2007), received the inaugural VLDB Women in Database Research Award (2016), an ACM SIGMOD Test-of-Time Award (2017), an NSF CAREER Award (2009), a 10-year most influential paper award (2010), the UW CSE ACM Teaching Award (2013), the Jean Loup Baer Career Development Professorship in Computer Science and Engineering (2014-2017), two Google Research Awards (2011 and 2018), an HP Labs Research Innovation Award (2009 and 2010), a Rogel Faculty Support Award (2006), a Microsoft Research Graduate Fellowship (2003-2005), and multiple best-paper (and "best of") awards.

## The DSIA Vision

Database researchers have developed techniques for storing and
querying massive amounts of data, including methods for distributed,
streaming and approximate computation. Machine learning techniques
provide ways to discover unexpected patterns and to automate and scale
well-defined analysis procedures. Recent systems research has looked
at how to develop novel database systems architectures to support the
iterative, optimization-oriented workloads of machine learning
algorithms.

Of course, both the inputs and outputs of these systems are ultimately
driven by people, in support of analysis tasks. The life-cycle of data
involves an iterative, interactive process of determining which
questions to ask, the data to analyze, appropriate features and
models, and interpreting results. In order to achieve better analysis
outcomes, data processing systems require improved interfaces that
account for the strengths and limitations of human perception and
cognition. Meanwhile, to keep up with the rising tide of data,
interactive visualization tools need to integrate more techniques from
databases and machine learning.

**In this workshop, we will explore the idea that the next generation of
database, machine learning, and interactive visualization systems
should not be designed in isolation**. For example, machine learning
techniques might recommend improved data transformation and visual
encoding decisions. Or, database query optimizers might take advantage
of perceptual constraints, while prefetching methods reduce latency by
modeling likely interactions.

This workshop seeks to jump start cross-pollination between these
fields. The program will be split between invited talks from
researchers in these communities, and speculative, ongoing work that
straddles the areas.

The goal of DSIA is to foster innovative research at the
**intersection of databases, machine learning, and interactive
visualization**.

## Topics

This workshop will focus on interactive systems: techniques,
methods, architecture, systems that enable the user to interactively
explore and analyze large amounts of data in the back end with
little or no latency. We encourage late-breaking work,
research in progress, and position papers in interactive analysis,
broadly construed. For example, topics of interest to the workshop include (but are not limited to):

* design of database architectures for interactive analysis
* novel database applications for interactive analysis
* novel database techniques based on perceptual constraints and
  human-centered design
* evaluation of database systems for interactive analysis
* identify unique characteristics of databases for supporting visualization
* communication protocols between front and back ends
* techniques for data storage, retrieval, compression, transformation,
  sampling, and streaming
* techniques for metadata generation
* front-end architectures that exploit these novel back-end capabilities

We are interested, more generally, in the questions that arise at the
*intersection* of these systems.
