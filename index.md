[IEEE VIS 2017](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/welcome), the [third edition of DSIA](/year/2018/) was held at
[IEEE VIS 2018](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome), and the fourth edition of the workshop was
held at [IEEE VIS 2019](http://ieeevis.org) in Vancouver.

## The DSIA Vision

Database researchers have developed techniques for storing and
querying massive amounts of data, including methods for distributed,
streaming and approximate computation. Machine learning techniques
provide ways to discover unexpected patterns and to automate and scale
well-defined analysis procedures. Recent systems research has looked
at how to develop novel database systems architectures to support the
iterative, optimization-oriented workloads of machine learning
algorithms.

Of course, both the inputs and outputs of these systems are ultimately
driven by people, in support of analysis tasks. The life-cycle of data
involves an iterative, interactive process of determining which
questions to ask, the data to analyze, appropriate features and
models, and interpreting results. In order to achieve better analysis
outcomes, data processing systems require improved interfaces that
account for the strengths and limitations of human perception and
cognition. Meanwhile, to keep up with the rising tide of data,
interactive visualization tools need to integrate more techniques from
databases and machine learning.

**In this workshop, we will explore the idea that the next generation of
database, machine learning, and interactive visualization systems
should not be designed in isolation**. For example, machine learning
techniques might recommend improved data transformation and visual
encoding decisions. Or, database query optimizers might take advantage
of perceptual constraints, while prefetching methods reduce latency by
modeling likely interactions.

This workshop seeks to jump start cross-pollination between these
fields. The program will be split between invited talks from
researchers in these communities, and speculative, ongoing work that
straddles the areas.

The goal of DSIA is to foster innovative research at the
**intersection of databases, machine learning, and interactive
visualization**.

## Topics

This workshop will focus on interactive systems: techniques,
methods, architecture, systems that enable the user to interactively
explore and analyze large amounts of data in the back end with
little or no latency. We encourage late-breaking work,
research in progress, and position papers in interactive analysis,
broadly construed. For example, topics of interest to the workshop include (but are not limited to):

* design of database architectures for interactive analysis
* novel database applications for interactive analysis
* novel database techniques based on perceptual constraints and
  human-centered design
* evaluation of database systems for interactive analysis
* identify unique characteristics of databases for supporting visualization
* communication protocols between front and back ends
* techniques for data storage, retrieval, compression, transformation,
  sampling, and streaming
* techniques for metadata generation
* front-end architectures that exploit these novel back-end capabilities

We are interested, more generally, in the questions that arise at the
*intersection* of these systems.
